## Hi, I'm Mykyta 👋

Frontend Engineer focused on **production-ready React applications**, clean architecture, and predictable state management.  
I build maintainable SPAs with real business logic, async data flows, and testing in mind.

I also have professional experience in multilingual localization (EN / UA / RU), which helps when working on international, content-heavy products.
