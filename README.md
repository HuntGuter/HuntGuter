## 🎮 Localization & Content

Beyond frontend, I have strong experience in:

- Technical, legal, and educational documents translation
- Game localization (Five-BN Games and others)  
- Website and app content adaptation (EN / UA / RU)  
- Researching and structuring content for e-commerce and product catalogs

If a role combines **technical UI work + multilingual content**, that’s a perfect match for me.
